abstract ={Association studies based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) can
 provide high resolution for identifying genes that may contribute to
 phenotypic variation. We report patterns of local and genome-wide LD in
 102 maize inbred lines representing much of the worldwide genetic
 diversity used in maize breeding, and address its implications for
 association studies in maize. In a survey of six genes, we found that
 intragenic LD generally declined rapidly with distance
 (r2 < 0.1 within 1500 bp), but rates
 of decline were highly variable among genes. This rapid decline
 probably reflects large effective population sizes in maize during its
 evolution and high levels of recombination within genes. A set of 47
 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci showed stronger evidence of
 genome-wide LD than did single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
 candidate genes. LD was greatly reduced but not eliminated by grouping
 lines into three empirically determined subpopulations. SSR data also
 supplied evidence that divergent artificial selection on flowering time
 may have played a role in generating population structure. Provided the
 effects of population structure are effectively controlled, this
 research suggests that association studies show great promise for
 identifying the genetic basis of important traits in maize with very
 high resolution.},

Hybridization between crops and their wild relatives provides a mechanism by which this could occur. While hybridization has been documented between several crops and wild or weedy relatives, little is known about the persistence of cultivar genes in wild populations in the generations following hybridization. Wild and weedy sunflowers occur symmetrically with cultivated sunflowers throughout much of the cultivation range, and hybridization is known to occur. We surveyed two cultivar-specific RAPD markers in 2700 progeny in a naturally occurring population of \emph{Helianthus annus} over five generations following a single generation of hybridization with the cultivar. Moderate levels of gene flow were detected in the first generation (42\% hybrids at the crop margin) and cultivar allele frequencies did not significantly decline over four subsequent generations. These results indicate that gene flow from cultivated  into wild populations of sunflowers can result in the long-term establishment of cultivar alleles in wild populations. Furthermore, we conclude that neutral or favorable transgenes have the potential to escapee and persist in wild sunflower populations.}}

Instead, our results indicate that all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. Our analyses also indicate that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands with maize spreading from this region over the Americas along two major paths. Our phylogenetic work is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands. We also found only modest evidence for postdomestication gene flow from teosinte into maize.},

Molecular analyses identified one form of teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) as the progenitor of maize. Analyses of the inheritance of the morphological traits that distinguish maize and teosinte indicates that they are under the control of multiple genes and exhibit quantitative inheritance. Nevertheless, these analyses have also identified a few loci of large effect that appear to represent key innovations during maize domestication.

Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of modern maize based on the genome-wide resequencing of 75 wild, landrace and improved maize lines(3). We find evidence of recovery of diversity after domestication, likely introgression from wild relatives, and evidence for stronger selection during domestication than improvement. We identify a number of genes with stronger signals of selection than those previously shown to underlie major morphological changes(4,5). Finally, through transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression, we find evidence both consistent with removal of cis-acting variation during maize domestication and improvement and suggestive of modern breeding having increased dominance in expression while targeting highly expressed genes.},

Regression and interval mapping analyses gave largely congruent results concerning the numbers of loci controlling the morphological traits and the magnitudes of their effects; however, interval mapping tended to give larger estimates for the magnitudes of the effects of the morphological trait loci. This tendency was exaggerated for traits that were non-normally distributed. Variation for most inflorescence traits is controlled by one or two regions of the genome with large effects plus several other regions with relatively small effects. As such, the data are congruent with a mode of inheritance for most traits involving one or two major loci plus several minor loci. Regions of the genome with large effects on one trait consistently had smaller effects on several other traits, possibly as a result of pleiotropy. Most of the variation for the dramatic differences in inflorescence morphology between maize and teosinte is explained by five restricted regions of the genome. One of these regions encompasses a previously described gene, tb1 (teosinte branched), and the effects of this region on inflorescence architecture are similar to the known effects of tb1. Implications of this work for the genetic basis of morphological evolution in plants are discussed.},

Plants of each of the four two-locus homozygous classes for the two QTL were grown in two environments. Three morphological traits and the level of mRNA accumulation for one QTL (teosinte branched1, tb1) were measured. tb1 has a large additive effect on morphology that was correlated with its message level. The second QTL had only negligible effects on morphology when isolated in an isogenic background, but exhibited a strong interaction effect on morphology in combination with tb1. This interaction is also evident in tb1 message levels, suggesting that this second QTL may act as an upstream regulator of tb1. The combined effect of the maize alleles at the two QTL makes tb1 message levels over fourfold higher. Plants homozygous for the teosinte allele at tb1 showed greater phenotypic plasticity across environments than plants homozygous for the maize allele. Our results support two hypotheses. First, maize plant architecture may have evolved by selection for a gene complex rather than the additive effects of individual loci alone. Secondly, selection during maize domestication for an allele of tb1 which lacks environmental plasticity may have led to the fixation of a morphological form that can be induced in teosinte by environmental conditions.},

Although the list of examples of transposable elements associated with host gene function continues to grow, proof that transposable elements are causative and not just correlated with functional variation is limited. Here we show that a transposable element (Hopscotch) inserted in a regulatory region of the maize domestication gene, teosinte branched1 (tb1), acts as an enhancer of gene expression and partially explains the increased apical dominance in maize compared to its progenitor, teosinte. Molecular dating indicates that the Hopscotch insertion predates maize domestication by at least 10,000 years, indicating that selection acted on standing variation rather than new mutation.},

Previously, tb1 was shown to confer large effects on both plant architecture and ear morphology between domesticated maize and teosinte; however, the effect of tb1 on trait variation in natural populations of teosinte has not been investigated. We compare the effects of nine teosinte alleles of tb1 that were introgressed into an isogenic maize inbred background. Our results provide evidence for a natural allelic series at tb1 for several complex morphological traits. The teosinte introgressions separate into three distinct phenotypic classes, which correspond to the taxonomic origin of the alleles. The effects of the three allelic classes also correspond to known morphological differences between the teosinte taxa. Our results suggest that tb1 contributed to the morphological diversification of teosinte taxa as well as to the domestication of maize.},

Consequently favoured alleles at genes controlling traits of interest increased in frequency, ultimately reaching fixation. When selection is strong, domestication has the potential to drastically reduce genetic diversity in a crop. To understand the impact of selection during maize domestication, we examined nucleotide polymorphism in teosinte branched1, a gene involved in maize evolution(2). Here we show that the effects of selection were limited to the gene’s regulatory region and cannot be detected in the protein-coding region. Although selection was apparently strong, high rates of recombination and a prolonged domestication period probably limited its effects. Our results help to explain why maize is such a variable crop. They also suggest that maize domestication required hundreds of years, and confirm precious evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte of southwestern Mexico.},

We used a fine mapping approach to show that intergenic sequences similar to 58-69 kb 5’ to the tb1 cDNA confer pleiotropic effects on Z. mays morphology. Moreover, using an allele-specific expression assay, we found that sequences > 41 kb upstream of tb1 act in cis to alter tb1 transcription.

abstract = {Loci involved in local adaptation can potentially be identified by an unusual correlation between allele frequencies and important ecological variables or by extreme allele frequency differences between geographic regions. However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the neutral correlation of allele frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene flow. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We first estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide a measure of the support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global F-ST.

abstract = {Whereas breeders have exploited diversity in maize for yield improvements, there has been limited progress in using beneficial alleles in undomesticated varieties. Characterizing standing variation in this complex genome has been challenging, with only a small fraction of it described to date. Using a population genetics scoring model, we identified 55 million SNPs in 103 lines across pre-domestication and domesticated Zea mays varieties, including a representative from the sister genus Tripsacum. We find that structural variations are pervasive in the Z. mays genome and are enriched at loci associated with important traits. By investigating the drivers of genome size variation, we find that the larger Tripsacum genome can be explained by transposable element abundance rather than an allopolyploid origin. In contrast, intraspecies genome size variation seems to be controlled by chromosomal knob content. There is tremendous overlap in key gene content in maize and Tripsacum, suggesting that adaptations from Tripsacum (for example, perennialism and frost and drought tolerance) can likely be integrated into maize.},

It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows, identification oof subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster.

abstract = {The teosinte taxon, Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, is the most closely related wild relative to maize and houses a significant amount of genetic diversity that could be important for maize improvement. Populations of parviglumis are found throughout southwest Mexico where recent changes in land use such as conversion to ranching and industrial agriculture threaten their persistence. Five populations of parviglumis in the rapidly changing rural landscape of central Jalisco were investigated in order to assess evidence for recent population bottlenecks and associated impacts of land use. Smaller, more fragmented, relic populations in regions with pervasive cattle grazing were shown to have less genetic diversity and stronger evidence of recent bottlenecks than larger, more continuous populations. Genetic diversity was strongly structured between populations with divergence occurring in populations separated by merely a few kilometers. The striking amount of regional genetic structure can be explained by the prevalence of pollen flow over short distances revealed through indirect paternity analysis in a separate investigation described here. This analysis of pollen flow also revealed trends related to land use and underscored the importance of considering cryptic population structure when estimating mating system parameters. Finally, a common garden comparison of thousands of plants from the five populations provided convincing evidence of inbreeding depression in smaller, more fragmented populations. These data, when considered together, underscore the need for concerted conservation effort toward parviglumis. Protection of these populations can be achieved through extension efforts with local land managers and by establishing parviglumis as a reference species for ecological and evolutionary studies based on the molecular tools available from maize.},

A large backcross (BC)(1) population derived from a cross between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte (ssp. parviglumis) was grown for the analysis. A total of 1749 progenies were genotyped for 304 markers and measured for 22 morphological traits. The results are in agreement with earlier studies showing a small number of genomic regions having greater impact on the morphological traits distinguishing maize and teosinte. Despite considerable power to detect epistasis, few QTL interactions were identified. To create a permanent resource, seed of BC, plants was archived and 1000 BC2S6 BC1-derived lines are in development for fine mapping and cloning. The identification of four BC1 progeny with crossovers in a single gene, tb1, indicated that enough derived lines already exist to clone many QTL without the need to generate and identify additional crossovers.},

Genetic variation in the promoter of the lactase gene (LCT) is known to be associated with lactase production and is therefore a genetic determinant for either lactase deficiency or lactase persistence during adulthood. Large differences in this genetic trait exist between populations in Africa and the Middle-East on the one hand, and European populations on the other; this is thought to be due to evolutionary pressures exerted by consumption of dairy products in Neolithic populations in Europe. In this study, we have investigated lactase persistence of 26 out of 46 individuals from Late Neolithic through analysis of ancient South-West European DNA samples, obtained from two burials in the Basque Country originating from 5000 to 4500 YBP. This investigation revealed that these populations had an average frequency of lactase persistence of 27%, much lower than in the modern Basque population, which is compatible with the concept that Neolithic and post-Neolithic evolutionary pressures by cattle domestication and consumption of dairy products led to high lactase persistence in Southern European populations. Given the heterogeneity in the frequency of the lactase persistence allele in ancient Europe, we suggest that in Southern Europe the selective advantage of lactose assimilation in adulthood most likely took place from standing population variation, after cattle domestication, at a post-Neolithic time when fresh milk consumption was already fully adopted as a consequence of a cultural influence.},

Thus, study of the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation is crucial not only for the understanding of natural evolutionary processes but also for the understanding of human-induced evolutionary change, which is an increasingly important problem [1-8]. In the present study, we demonstrate that the frequency of completely plated threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has increased in an urban freshwater lake (Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington) within the last 40 years. This is a dramatic example of “reverse evolution,” [9] because the general evolutionary trajectory is toward armor-plate reduction in freshwater sticklebacks [10]. On the basis of our genetic studies and simulations, we propose that the most likely cause of reverse evolution is increased selection for the completely plated morph, which we suggest could result from higher levels of trout predation after a sudden increase in water transparency during the early 1970s. Rapid evolution was facilitated by the existence of standing allelic variation in Ectodysplasin (Eda), the gene that underlies the major plate-morph locus [11]. The Lake Washington stickleback thus provides a novel example of reverse evolution, which is probably caused by a change in allele frequency at the major plate locus in response to a changing predation regime.},

From DNA sequence data for three nuclear loci and mtDNA, we infer that an ancestral, hawthorn-infesting R. pomonella population became geographically subdivided into Mexican and North American isolates approximate to1.57 million years ago. Episodes of gene flow from Mexico subsequently infused the North American population with inversion polymorphism affecting key diapause traits, forming adaptive clines. Sometime later (perhaps +/-1 million years), diapause variation in the latitudinal clines appears to have aided North American flies in adapting to a variety of plants with differing fruiting times, helping to spawn several new taxa. Thus, important raw genetic material facilitating the adaptive radiation of R. pomonella originated in a different time and place than the proximate ecological host shifts triggering sympatric divergence.},

abstract = {Modern maize was domesticated from Zea mays parviglumis, a teosinte, about 9000 years ago in Mexico. Genes thought to have been selected upon during the domestication of crops are commonly known as domestication loci. The ramosa1 (ra1) gene encodes a putative transcription factor that controls branching architecture in the maize tassel and ear. Previous work demonstrated reduced nucleotide diversity in a segment of the ra1 gene in a survey of modern maize inbreds, indicating that positive selection occurred at some point in time since maize diverged from its common ancestor with the sister species Tripsacum dactyloides and prompting the hypothesis that ra1 may be a domestication gene. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined ear phenotypes resulting from minor changes in ra1 activity and sampled nucleotide diversity of ra1 across the phylogenetic spectrum between tripsacum and maize, including a broad panel of teosintes and unimproved maize landraces. Weak mutant alleles of ra1 showed subtle effects in the ear, including crooked rows of kernels due to the occasional formation of extra spikelets, correlating a plausible, selected trait with subtle variations in gene activity. Nucleotide diversity was significantly reduced for maize landraces but not for teosintes, and statistical tests implied directional selection on ra1 consistent with the hypothesis that ra1 is a domestication locus. In maize landraces, a noncoding 3’-segment contained almost no genetic diversity and 5’-flanking diversity was greatly reduced, suggesting that a regulatory element may have been a target of selection.},

abstract = {The shape of a plant is largely determined by regulation of lateral branching. Branching architecture can vary widely in response to both genotype and environment, suggesting regulation by a complex interaction of autonomous genetic factors and external signals. Tillers, branches initiated at the base of grass plants, are suppressed in response to shade conditions. This suppression of tiller and lateral branch growth is an important trait selected by early agriculturalists during maize domestication and crop improvement. To understand how plants integrate external environmental cues with endogenous signals to control their architecture, we have begun a functional characterization of the maize mutant grassy tillers1 (gt1). We isolated the gt1 gene using positional cloning and found that it encodes a class I homeodomain leucine zipper gene that promotes lateral bud dormancy and suppresses elongation of lateral ear branches. The gt1 expression is induced by shading and is dependent on the activity of teosinte branched1 (tb1), a major domestication locus controlling tillering and lateral branching. Interestingly, like tb1, gt1 maps to a quantitative trait locus that regulates tillering and lateral branching in maize and shows evidence of selection during maize domestication. Branching and shade avoidance are both of critical agronomic importance, but little is known about how these processes are integrated. Our results indicate that gt1 mediates the reduced branching associated with the shade avoidance response in the grasses. Furthermore, selection at the gt1 locus suggests that it was involved in improving plant architecture during the domestication of maize.},

The persistence of weedy rice has been attributed, in part, to its ability to shatter (disperse) seed prior to crop harvesting.

Here, we investigate the shattering phenotype in a collection of U.S. weedy rice accessions, as well as wild and cultivated relatives. We find that all U.S. weedy rice groups shatter seeds easily, despite multiple origins, and in contrast to a decrease in shattering ability seen in cultivated groups. We assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus, sh4, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice, regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at sh4, and all contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed shattering. Our data constitute the strongest evidence to date of an evolution of weeds from domesticated backgrounds. The combination of a shared cultivar sh4 allele and a highly shattering phenotype, suggests that U.S. weedy rice have re-acquired the shattering trait after divergence from their progenitors through alternative genetic mechanisms.},

Interest in crop-wild gene flow has increased with the advent of transgenic plants, but nontransgenic crop-wild hybrids can provide case studies to understand the factors influencing introgression, provided that the genetic architecture and the fitness effects of loci are known. This study used recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from a cross between crop and wild sunflowers to assess selection on domestication traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) in two contrasting environments, in Indiana and Nebraska, USA. Only a small fraction of plants (9%) produced seed in Nebraska, due to adverse weather conditions, while the majority of plants (79%) in Indiana reproduced. Phenotypic selection analysis found that a mixture of crop and wild traits were favoured in Indiana (i.e. had significant selection gradients), including larger leaves, increased floral longevity, larger disk diameter, reduced ray flower size and smaller achene (seed) mass. Selection favouring early flowering was detected in Nebraska. QTLs for fitness were found at the end of linkage groups six (LG6) and nine (LG9) in both field sites, each explaining 11-12% of the total variation. Crop alleles were favoured on LG9, but wild alleles were favoured on LG6. QTLs for numerous domestication traits overlapped with the fitness QTLs, including flowering date, achene mass, head number, and disk diameter. It remains to be seen if these QTL clusters are the product of multiple linked genes, or individual genes with pleiotropic effects.

abstract = {The domestication of plants frequently results in a high level of genetic differentiation between domesticated plants and their wild progenitors. This process is counteracted by gene flow between wild and domesticated plants because they are usually able to inter-mate and to exchange genes. We investigated the extent of gene flow between wild barley Hordeum spontaneum and cultivated barley Hordeum vulgare, and its effect on population structure in wild barley by analysing a collection of 896 wild barley accessions (Barley1K) from Israel and all available Israeli H. vulgare accessions from the Israeli gene bank. We compared the performance of simple sequence repeats (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) marker data genotyped over a core collection in estimating population parameters. Estimates of gene flow rates with SSR markers indicated a high level of introgression from cultivated barley into wild barley. After removing accessions from the wild barley sample that were recently admixed with cultivated barley, the inference of population structure improved significantly. Both SSR and SNP markers showed that the genetic population structure of wild barley in Israel corresponds to the three major ecogeographic regions: the coast, the Mediterranean north and the deserts in the Jordan valley and the South. Gene flow rates were estimated to be higher from north to south than in the opposite direction. As has been observed in other crop species, there is a significant exchange of alleles between the wild species and domesticated varieties that needs to be accounted for in the population genetic analysis of domestication.},

abstract = {The last two decades have seen important advances in our knowledge of maize domestication, thanks in part to the contributions of genetic data. Genetic studies have provided firm evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte (Zea mays subspecies parviglumis), a wild relative that is endemic to the mid-to lowland regions of southwestern Mexico. An interesting paradox remains, however: Maize cultivars that are most closely related to Balsas teosinte are found mainly in the Mexican highlands where subspecies parviglumis does not grow. Genetic data thus point to primary diffusion of domesticated maize from the highlands rather than from the region of initial domestication. Recent archeological evidence for early lowland cultivation has been consistent with the genetics of domestication, leaving the issue of the ancestral position of highland maize unresolved. We used a new SNP dataset scored in a large number of accessions of both teosinte and maize to take a second look at the geography of the earliest cultivated maize. We found that gene flow between maize and its wild relatives meaningfully impacts our inference of geographic origins. By analyzing differentiation from inferred ancestral gene frequencies, we obtained results that are fully consistent with current ecological, archeological, and genetic data concerning the geography of early maize cultivation.},

Despite a detailed knowledge of the function of these genes little is known about how they contribute to the natural variation for complex traits. To determine whether major regulatory genes of maize contribute to standing variation in Balsas teosinte we conducted association mapping in 584 Balsas teosinte individuals. We tested 48 markers from nine candidate regulatory genes against 13 traits for plant and infloresence architecture. We identified significant associations using a mixed linear model that controls for multiple levels of relatedness. Ten associations involving five candidate genes were significant after correction for multiple testing, and two survive the conservative Bonferroni correction. zfl2, the maize homolog of FLORICAULA of Antirrhinum, was associated with plant height. zap1, the maize homolog of APETALA1 of Arabidopsis, was associated with inflorescence branching. Five SNPs in the maize domestication gene, teosinte branched1, were significantly associated with either plant or inflorescence architecture. Our data suggest that major regulatory genes in maize do play a role in the natural variation for complex traits in teosinte and that some of the minor variants we identified may have been targets of selection during domestication.},

abstract = {The domestication of crop plants has often involved an increase in apical dominance (the concentration of resources in the main stem of the plant and a corresponding suppression of axillary branches)(1). A striking example of this phenomenon is seen in maize (Zea mays spp. mays), which exhibits a profound increase in apical dominance compared with its probable wild ancestor, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis)(2). Previous research has identified the teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene as a major contributor to this evolutionary change in maize(3). We have cloned tb1 by transposon tagging and show here that it encodes a protein with homology to the cycloidea gene of snapdragon(4). The pattern of tb1 expression and the morphology of tb1 mutant plants suggest that tb1 acts both to repress the growth of axillary organs and to enable the formation of female inflorescences. The maize allele of tb1 is expressed at twice the level of the teosinte allele, suggesting that gene regulatory changes underlie the evolutionary divergence of maize from teosinte.},

population derived from a cross of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and its probable progenitor, teosinte (Z. 
mays ssp. paviglumis). A total of 50 significant associations (putative QTLs) between the MMLs and 
nine key traits that distinguish maize and teosinte were identified. Results from this analysis are 
compared with our previous analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross of a different variety 
of maize and another subspecies of teosinte (Z. mays ssp. mexicana). For traits that measure the 
architectural differences between maize and teosinte, the two F2 populations possessed similar suites 
of QTLs. For traits that measure components of yield, substantially different suites of QTLs were 
identified in the two populations. QTLs that control about 20\% or more of the phenotypic variance 
for a trait in one population were detected in the other population 81 \% of the time, while QTLs that 
control less than 10\% of the variance in one population were detected in the other population only 
28\% of the time. In our previously published analysis of the maize X ssp. mexicana population, we 
identified five regions of the genome that control most of the key morphological differences between 
maize and teosinte. These same five regions also control most of the differences in the maize X ssp. 
pamiglumis population. Results from both populations support the hypothesis that a relatively small 
number of loci with large effects were involved in the early evolution of the key traits that distinguish 
maize and teosinte. It is suggested that loci with large effects on morphology may not be a specific 
feature of crop evolution, but rather a common phenomenon in plant evolution whenever a species 
invades a new niche with reduced competition.}}

these, which is on chromosome arm lL, is the locus for the maize mutant teosinte branchedl (tbl). This 
QTL has effects on inflorescence sex and the number and length of internodes in the lateral branches 
and inflorescences. This QTL has strong phenotypic effects in teosinte background but reduced effects 
in maize background. The second QTL, which is on chromosome arm X, affects the same traits as the 
QTL on 1L. We identify two candidate loci for this QTL. The effects of this QTL on several traits are 
reduced in both maize and teosinte background as compared to a maize-teosinte F2 population. Genetic 
background appears to affect gene action for both QTL. Analysis of a population in which both QTL 
were segregating revealed that they interact epistatically. Together, these two QTL substantially transform 
both plant and inflorescence architecture. We propose that tbl is involved in the teosinte plant?s response 
to local environment to produce either long or short branches and that maize evolution involved a 
change at this locus to produce short branches under all environments.}}

We investigated the genetic history by which the wild grass teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) was domesticated into modern maize (Z. mays ssp. mays). Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 774 genes indicates that 2 to 4\% of these genes experienced artificial selection. The remaining genes retain evidence of a population bottleneck associated with domestication. Candidate selected genes with putative function in plant growth are clustered near quantitative trait loci that contribute to phenotypic differences between maize and teosinte. If we assume that our sample of genes is representative, ?1200 genes throughout the maize genome have been affected by artificial selection.},

abstract ={Surveys of nucleotide diversity in the wild ancestor of maize, Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, have revealed genomewide departures from the standard neutral equilibrium (NE) model. Here we investigate the degree to which population structure may account for the excess of rare polymorphisms frequently observed in species-wide samples. On the basis of sequence data from five nuclear and two chloroplast loci, we found significant population genetic structure among seven subpopulations from two geographic regions. Comparisons of estimates of population genetic parameters from species-wide samples and subpopulation-specific samples showed that population genetic subdivision influenced observed patterns of nucleotide polymorphism. In particular, Tajima's D was significantly higher (closer to zero) in subpopulation-specific samples relative to species-wide samples, and therefore more closely corresponded to NE expectations. In spite of these overall patterns, the extent to which levels and patterns of polymorphism within subpopulations differed from species-wide samples and NE expectations depended strongly on the geographic region (Jalisco vs. Balsas) from which subpopulations were sampled. This may be due to the demographic history of subpopulations in those regions. Overall, these results suggest that explicitly accounting for population structure may be important for studies examining the genetic basis of ecologically and agronomically important traits as well as for identifying loci that have been the targets of selection.},
