\maketitle

The \emph{teosinte branched1} (\emph{tb1}) gene, a repressor of lateral organ growth, was identified as a major QTL involved in branching differences between maize and its wild progenitor, teosinte. Further studies have shown that the insertion of a transposable element (Hopscotch) upstream of \emph{tb1} enhances its expression, causing the reduction in branching observed in domesticated maize. Observations of the maize \emph{tb1} allele in teosinte individuals, coupled with estimates of the age of insertion of the Hopscotch element, led us to investigate the role of \emph{tb1} in teosinte. Results from genotyping across many natural populations suggest that the Hopscotch element is segregating at a higher than expected frequency in a number of populations of both subspecies parviglumis and mexicana. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the Hopscotch element and variation in surrounding regions does not support a hypothesis of recent introgression from maize into teosinte, yet we find no correlation between the frequency of the Hopscotch insertion and environmental variables. Furthermore, we find no correlation between branching architecture traits measured and the Hopscotch, and the role of the Hopscotch insertion, if any, in the ecology of teosinte may be more complicated.
